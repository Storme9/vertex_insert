# vertex_insert
Blender add-on: Select two vertices. Set a distance. Click any of the three buttons. Depending on which button you press, a vertex or vertices will be placed between (on the line made by the two selected vertices) the two selected vertices - at the set distance from either of the selected vertices or from both.
